## Overview
Volunteer Organizer App: This is an app where users can sign-up to volunteer for events created by organizations. Users will find this useful as both volunteers and organizations will be able to  list, search, create and contact events/volunteers as well as build profiles and review users.

This idea came from the need for relevant volunteer opportunities to be easily visible to potential volunteers.

## Features
* User Authentication/Authorization: Users can sign-up as Organizations or Volunteers to create profile and login
* Manage Volunteer Opportunities: Organization users can create, updated, and delete volunteer events
* Sign-Up: Volunteer users can sign for volunteer opportunities
* Search: Users can search for Volunteers, Events, or Organizations
* Authorization Security: User has 3 attempts to enter their password
* Review: Organizations and volunteers can review/endorse either volunteers or organizations/events (respectively)
* Auto-match: Volunteers can be auto-matched to (suggested) events based on specified profile information (skills, location, time available, etc.)

Minimum Viable Product (MVP):
* User Authentication/Authorization (Able to create account & login)
* Manage Volunteer Opportunities (Organization Users can create volunteer opportunities)
* Search (Volunteer Users can search for volunteer opportunities)
